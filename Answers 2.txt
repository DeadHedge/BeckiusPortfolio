Questions: Round 2

1. About a four. Everything works, but it'll be a while before I can do it
	without a bunch of googling.
2. Research took a few hours, a mix of Stack Overflow, W3C, the textbook, and whatever other riffraff
	google swept my way. The difficulty came in figuring out how to intercept the form
	input for use in a JS function. My original solution was a bit too complicated.	
	But when I simplified, things clicked into place real fast.
3. I have a bunch of buttons wrapped in anchors. Help me. Please.
4. Getting and appending elements. You know, inspiration for me to not forget things over the weekend.
